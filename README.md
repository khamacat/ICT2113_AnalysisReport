# Team Repository

This repository supports the regulated revision of requirements, modelling artefacts, and testing processes. It is designed to provide clarity, transparency, and accountability throughout the project lifecycle.

## Structure Overview
- **BCIC/** – Breakdown, Clarify, Interpret, and Categorise folders, plus the Incongruous Requirements Checklist (IRC) tool used to flag problematic requirements.
- **Models/**  
  - *customer_provided/* – Baseline artefacts supplied by the customer (DFD, Gantt chart, Use Case).  
  - *team_developed/* – Refined and additional models created by the team (ERD, activity diagrams, sketches).  
- **References/** – External resources and academic references.  
- **Reports/** – Executive summaries and progress reports.  
- **requirements/**  
  - *assumption/* – Documented assumptions.  
  - *constraints/* – Constraints placeholders.  
  - *hardware/* – Hardware requirements placeholders.  
  - *software/* – Subfolders for Registration & Staff Onboarding, Course Administration, Timetable Scheduling, Attendance Management, and Monitoring & Reporting.  
- **Tasks/** – Backlog and task tracking.  
- **Test_Processes/** – Documentation of unit, integration, and acceptance testing workflows.

## Features
- **Version Control:** GitHub tracks all changes to requirements, models, and test processes.  
- **Issues & Projects:** Tasks are assigned and monitored transparently, supporting accountability.  
- **Sanity Check Step:** Repository acts as a central review point before transitioning to the Specifying phase.  
- **Documentation:** Each folder contains placeholder files or artefacts to scaffold future content.

## Current Status
The repository is fully structured with placeholders and baseline artefacts. Team-developed models and requirement refinements are in progress. The IRC tool is actively used to classify incongruities, and GitHub Issues/Projects are being prepared for Kanban tracking.

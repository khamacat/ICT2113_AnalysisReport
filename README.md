# Team Repository

This repository supports regulated-revision of requirements and safe-keeping until the final SRS template is ready. It is structured to align with CRaM principles (Contextually Relevant & Meaningful).

## Structure
- **Assumptions/** – Notes on assumptions made during analysis.
- **Requirements/**  
  - *business_ops.md* – Business operations requirements.  
  - *technical_reqs.md* – Technical requirements.  
  - *incongruent_reqs.md* – Requirements flagged via IRC as incongruent.  
- **Models/** – UML diagrams and prototypes (e.g., ERD, activity diagram, use case sketches).  
- **Tasks/** – Task backlog and progress tracking, supported by GitHub Issues and Projects.  
- **Reports/** – Executive summary and progress reports.  
- **Deliverables/** – Drafts of posters, scripts, and other outputs.  
- **References/** – External resources and academic references.  

## Features
- **Version Control:** GitHub tracks changes, ensuring requirements and diagrams are safely updated.  
- **Issues & Projects:** Tasks can be assigned and tracked transparently, supporting accountability.  
- **Wiki/README:** Explains repository structure and navigation for team members.  
- **Sanity Check Step:** Repository acts as a central review point before transitioning to the Specifying phase.  

## Current Status
Placeholder files have been created in each folder to demonstrate readiness and provide scaffolding for future content. GitHub Issues and Projects are already in use to track tasks such as drafting requirements and preparing UML diagrams. This setup ensures the repository is not only functional but also aligned with CRaM principles of contextual relevance and meaningful organization.

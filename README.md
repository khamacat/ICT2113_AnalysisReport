# Repository Overview

A repository has been established to support the regulated revision of requirements and ensure safekeeping until the final specification stage. It is organised into dedicated folders for requirements, models, references, and the BCIC analysis stages. This structure provides clarity, transparency, and accountability throughout the development process.

## 3.1 Structure
- **/Requirement (From Customer PS)** – Contains elicited requirements and their codified versions, organised into subfolders for:
  - Software (Registration & Staff Onboarding, Course Administration, Timetable Scheduling, Attendance Management, Monitoring & Reporting)
  - Hardware
  - Constraints
- **/Models** – Stores modelling artefacts, separated into:
  - *customer_provided* (DFD, Gantt chart, use case)
  - *team_developed* (wireframes, organisational chart, and other team-created models)
- **/References** – Holds the original SUW ATAM Project Specification and other supporting materials.
- **/BCIC** – Supports requirement analysis through Breakdown, Clarify, Interpret, Categorise, and the Incongruous Requirements Checklist (IRC).
- **README.md** – Provides navigation and explanation of the repository structure.


## 3.2 Features
- **Version Control** – GitHub ensures all changes to requirements, models, and analysis documents are tracked safely.
- **Issues & Projects** – Tasks and incongruities are assigned and monitored transparently, supporting accountability.
- **Sanity Check Step** – Acts as a central review point before transitioning to the Specifying phase.
- **IRC Tool** – Provides a systematic way to classify and resolve incongruous requirements.

## 3.3 Current Status
The repository is now complete and actively in use. All BCIC stages — Breakdown, Categorise, Clarify, Interpret, and the IRC — have been carried through to completion. Many Issues raised during development have been closed, with only a very small number left open for reference. Requirements have been codified, models are organised, and supporting documents are properly structured across the repository. Overall, the repository is stable, comprehensive, and provides all relevant information in a clear and accessible format, ensuring readiness for the Specifying phase and final delivery

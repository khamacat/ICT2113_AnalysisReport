# Team-Developed Models

This folder contains modelling artefacts created or refined by the team. They build upon customer-provided diagrams and incorporate clarifications, improvements, and additional detail.

## Contents
- **temp** – temp
- **temp** – temp

## Purpose
- Translate customer input into **clear, testable models**.
- Resolve ambiguities and incongruities identified during review.
- Provide artefacts that will feed into the final SRS and design documentation.

## Notes
- These models are iterative and will evolve as requirements are clarified.
- Each diagram is version-controlled to ensure traceability.

# Team-Developed Models

This folder contains modelling artefacts created and refined by the project team.  
These artefacts complement the customer-provided models and reflect the team’s interpretation, design decisions, and refinements made during analysis.

## Contents
- **Wireframe** – Draft interface sketches illustrating proposed system interactions.
- **Org_Chart** – Temporary organisational chart used to visualise stakeholder roles and relationships.
- **BPMN** – Business Process Model and Notation diagrams that illustrate process flows, clarifications, and interactions (including with the Account Manager).

## Purpose
- Document models developed internally by the team for validation and refinement.
- Ensure alignment between requirements and design artefacts.
- Provide a reference point for clarifications and future specification work.

## Notes
- Artefacts in this folder are subject to iteration as requirements evolve.
- Finalised models will be cross-referenced with requirements to maintain traceability.

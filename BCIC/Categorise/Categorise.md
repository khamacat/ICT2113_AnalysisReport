# Repository Overview

The vendor team set up a structured template in the repository ([Link to GitHub Repo]) to organise business operations and technical requirements. This template provides a consistent framework for codification, using the **BO – x.x. numbering scheme** and folder organisation to ensure requirements are traceable and easy to navigate.

All requirements, along with supporting models such as diagrams and process sketches, have been fitted into this template. By integrating models directly with the requirements, the team avoided fragmentation and ensured that both textual and visual specifications are aligned within the same structure.

Incongruities are tracked transparently through the **Issues tab**, marked open or closed, and the Breakdown, Clarify, and Interpret stages are documented. This collaborative review confirms completeness and consistency, preparing the requirement set for the Specifying stage.

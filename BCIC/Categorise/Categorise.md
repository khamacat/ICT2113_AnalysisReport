# Repository Overview

This repository has been established with a structured template to support the project analysis process.  
It serves as a standardized framework for organizing both business operations and technical requirements, ensuring consistency and traceability across all materials.

All requirements, together with supporting models such as diagrams and process sketches, are integrated into this template. By consolidating textual and visual specifications within the same structure, the team avoids fragmentation and maintains alignment throughout development.

The repository also provides a mechanism for conducting sanity checks on the complete set of requirements before moving into the specification phase, reinforcing accuracy and readiness for subsequent stages.

| Suspected incompleteness/Unseemly Prioritised     | The requirement doesn’t define what customisations the system allows. Req marked ‘Tolerable’, however, mismatched with the description.

| Ambiguous/Inconsistent with other requirements    | Different terminologies are used for each role, such as ‘Administrative staff’, ‘Admin’, ‘Staff’, ‘Teaching Staff’, etc. Which terms refer to the same roles?                                                        | BRS - L1.3 Register staff, BC - L1.1 Create slot, BRA - L1.1: Record Attendance, BAS - L1.1 View attendance summaries | Contextual              |
| Ambiguous/Not Testable                            | Requirements are supposed to describe what the system must do, not what the user or admin must do. “Admin shall” is ambiguous in the system context. It is non-testable/unverifiable, because you cannot automatically verify what the admin does unless the system enforces it. | All requirements                                                                                       | Contextual              |
